# **Intel® oneAPI**

With computer system architecture entering a period of prosperity in which CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and AI Accelerators complementary to each other, the diversity of hardware brings the complexity of software design and development. Intel® oneAPI is a cross-industry, open, standards-based unified programming model that delivers a common developer experience across accelerator architectures—for faster application performance, more productivity, and greater innovation with its single, unified open development model for performant and productive heterogeneous programming and cross-vendor support.
